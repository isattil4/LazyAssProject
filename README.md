Lazy Assisstant Project
========================
This is an application i thought of when i was using my phone to stream a movie from my computer, it was pretty late
and i was tired and i didnt want to get up and shutdown the computer. So i thought why cant i build an application on
my phone to shutdown/hibernate the computer, and voila this application was born.

The Idea
---------
The idea is pretty simple. create a listener on the computer to recieve commands from the phone and to execute the program.

Constraints
------------
you have to be on the same wifi network as the computer in order to send the command.

Future Development
-------------------
1. use GCM to send commands if you are not in the same network
2. beef up security for local communications
3. create a widget for the application
